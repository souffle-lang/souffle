/**
 * Transformation pass that removes (binary) constraints on the anonymous records.
 * After resolving aliases this is equivalent to completely removing anonymous records.
 *
 * e.g.
 * [a, b, c] = [x, y, z] → a = x, b = y, c = z.
 * [a, b, c] != [x, y, z] →  a != x  b != y  c != z (expanded to three new clauses)
 *
 * In a single pass, in case of equalities  a transformation expands a single level
 * of records in every clause. (e.g. [[a]] = [[1]] => [a] = [1])
 * In case of inequalities, it expands at most a single inequality in every clause
 *
 *
 * This transformation does not resolve aliases.
 * E.g. A = [a, b], A = [c, d]
 * Thus it should be called in conjunction with ResolveAnonymousRecordsAliases.
