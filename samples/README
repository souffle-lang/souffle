This directory contains the specifications for both the context-insensitive
and 2O+1H context-sensitive analyses.

The directory common contains the specifications that are common to typical
Java analysis. It includes the declarations of EDB (or input facts), the type
declarations and the specification to model aspects of the open-world.

The directory abstract-pointsto contains the specifications that are common to
various versions of points-to analysis.

The directories java-ci-pointsto and java-cs-pointsto contain the specifications
that relate to the context-insensitive and context-sensitive analysis
respectively.

The files fullCIAnalysis.dl and fullCSAnalysis.dl are the expanded versions that
contain the necessary includes and is the one given to Souffle to compute the 
relevant results. The declaration of the relevant relation(s) in these files may be 
edited with either "output" or "printsize" to write the computed results to file or
just write on stdout the size of the relation.

The following command may be used to compute the contex-sensitive points-to results.

souffle -j8 -c -D <pathToOutput> -p <logFile> -F <factFilesDirectory>  fullCSAnalysis.dl

The flags -j8 indicate souffle to use at most 8 cores. The <pathToOutput> directory must
exist before issuing this command. The <logFile> generated by this command may be used 
to  examine the sizes of and runtime required for each of the generated relations.

The command to compute context-insensitive points-to results is as follows.

souffle -j8 -c -D <pathToOutput> -p <logFile> -F <factFilesDirectory>  fullCIAnalysis.dl
